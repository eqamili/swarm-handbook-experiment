            CFW_SHA_2Y txt file<br />
            The file format is such that any line starting with a &rdquo;#&rdquo; is a comment line. Then on the first (not- commented) line are given the minimum and maximum SH degree used, followed by the number of flow model snapshots.<br />
            <br />
            The second (not-commented) line contains the series of dates (in decimal years) corresponding to the flow snapshot models. On the remaining lines are given successively: a character &rdquo;T&rdquo; or &rdquo;P&rdquo; as an indication if the line is associated with a toroidal or poloidal flow coefficient, the SH degree of the coefficient, its order, and the time series for this coefficient at the dates indicated on the second line.<br />
            <br />
            CFW_SHA_2Y std file<br />
            The file format is the same as for the txt file but are given the flow coefficient standard deviations in place of the coefficients<br />
            <br />
            CFW_SHA_2Y cov file<br />
            In this independent file with the extension *.cov, the covariance matrice upper triangle (i.e. variances and covariances) is provided.<br />
            A covariance matrice being symmetric no information is lost.<br />
            <br />
            The format of the file is:<br />
            &bull; On the first line the series of dates (in decimal years) of the mean snapshot core flow models associated with the covariance matrices.<br />
            &bull; On the next lines are indicated: the row index of the covariance matrix, the column index of the covariance matrix, followed by the time series of variances or covariances in the order given by the first line dates. Units of matrix elements are (km/y)<sup>2</sup>.</td>
