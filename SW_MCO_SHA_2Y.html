            The format used has been set in accordance with the usual SHC format defined for this type of files. Units of Gauss coefficients are nT<br />
            With a very similar format the standard deviations of the Gauss coefficients are provided in an independent file with the extension *.std<br />
            The only difference in the format is on the first line where the B-spline order, and the number of intervals between spline knots, are not indicated. Units of standard deviations are nT.<br />

            <strong>MCO_SHA_2Ycov file</strong><br />
            In this independent file with the extension *.cov, the covariance matrice upper triangles (i.e. variances and covariances) is provided.<br />
            A covariance matrice being symmetric no information is lost.<br />
            The format of the file is:<br />
            &bull; On the first line the series of dates (in decimal years) of the mean snapshot core field models associated with the covariance matrices.<br />
            &bull; On the next lines are indicated: the row index of the covariance matrix, the column index of the covariance matrix, followed by the time series of variances or covariances in the order given by the first line dates. Units of matrix elements are nT<sup>2</sup>.</td>
